Do not plant peppers or tomatoes in a location where either of these crops has been grown in the past four or five years.\nAt the end of the season, remove all crop debris from the garden and destroy it. Do not compost plant debris that may contain the disease. Once the area is clean of all visible debris, till the soil or turn it with a shovel to bury any remaining bacteria.'

The disease primarily affects leaves and stems, but under favorable weather conditions, and if left uncontrolled, can result in considerable defoliation and enhance the chance for tuber infection.'
        solutions='Early blight can be minimized by maintaining optimum growing conditions, including proper fertilization, irrigation, and management of other pests.

        solutions='Prune or stake plants to improve air circulation and reduce fungal problems.\nMake sure to disinfect your pruning shears (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.\nKeep the soil under plants clean and free of garden debris. Add a layer of organic compost to prevent the spores from splashing back up onto vegetation.\nDrip irrigation and soaker hoses can be used to help keep the foliage dry.'

It is found throughout the world, predominantly on tomatoes grown where the relative humidity is high, particularly in plastic greenhouses. Occasionally, if conditions are just right, leaf mold of tomato can be a problem on field grown fruit.'

It is one of the most destructive diseases of tomato foliage and is particularly severe in areas where wet, humid weather persists for extended periods. Septoria leaf spot usually appears on the lower leaves after the first fruit sets.'
        solutions="Pinch off leaves with leaf spots and bury them in the compost pile.\nIt is okay to remove up to a third of the plant's leaves if you catch the disease early.\nDo not remove more than a third of the plant's leaves.\nKeep leaves dry to reduce spreading the disease."

Spider mites can occur in tomato, eggplant, potato, vine crops such as melons, cucumbers, and other crops. Two-spotted spider mites are one of the most important pests of eggplant.'
        solutions='The best way to begin treating for two-spotted mites is to apply a pesticide specific to mites called a miticide. Ideally, you should start treating for two-spotted mites before your plants are seriously damaged. Apply the miticide for control of two-spotted mites every 7 days or so. Since mites can develop resistance to chemicals, switch to another type of miticide after three applications.'

        solutions='The following tips for treating target spot on tomatoes should help: Remove old plant debris at the end of the growing season; otherwise, the spores will travel from debris to newly planted tomatoes in the following growing season, thus beginning the disease anew.'
